# Why buy local?
[Several studies](https://ilsr.org/key-studies-why-local-matters/) have shown that when you buy from an independent, locally-owned business, rather than a nationally-owned businesses, significantly more of your money is used to make purchases from other local businesses, service providers, and farms -- continuing to strengthen the economic base of the community.

Small local businesses are the largest employer nationally, and in our community, provide the most jobs to residents.

Local businesses are owned by people who live in this community, are less likely to leave, and are more invested in the communityâ€™s future.
